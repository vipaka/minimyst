Minimyst is a Minimalist PHP framework. Just 'cause.

Copy paste your copy of minimyst into your server directory of choice (/www/minimyst or 
/htdocs/minimyst for WAMP and MAMP). 

Modify the contents of your config.php file to match your working directory, database setup and whether
or not you need login functionality to change Minimyst's default out of the box behavior (9 lines). 

Minimyst is meant as a prototyping, performance testing and educational environment framework only. 
If you are building an application meant to involve security, scalability, or will need support for
multiple dependencies, Minimyst is likely not the right framework to choose.
